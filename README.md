# SEAT - Simple environmental Exposure Assessment Tool

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/706710214.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10018509)

SEAT is a simple environmental exposure assessment tool. It is meant for use in screening-level, conservative environmental exposure assessments, as a slightly more consistent approach than back-of-the-envelope calculations. It:
* calculates Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PECs) in surface waters, sediments and soils (but not the atmosphere or groundwater);
* is conservative, rather than realistic;
* treats chemicals as conservative tracers that do not degrade;
* makes conservative assumptions, such as the total released mass of a chemical goes to both waters and soils;
* is pragmatic in its data requirements, requiring only basic properties of the geographical region modelled;
* is open-source and licensed with a BSD-3-Clause license.

## Usage...
...is self-explanatory: Open up the spreadsheet and follow the instructions.
